# Docker Installation and Usage

This is the preferred method of deploying and operating the Deadeye system.
Docker is readily available on most, if not all, Linux distributions used on
vision coproccessors.

## Installation

We'll use the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool to deploy
and operate Deadeye. The example commands below work on an Orange Pi running
their Ubuntu jammy [server image](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-pi-5.html).

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

### Docker Compose

Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file as appropriate for your system. Select the
[docker image tags](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=j3ff/deadeye) to use and
edit the lines containing:

```yaml
daemon:
  image: j3ff/deadeye-daemon:<TAG>
admin:
  image: j3ff/deadeye-admin:<TAG>
web:
  image: j3ff/deadeye-web:<TAG>
```

There are a number of environment variables beginning with `DEADEYE_` that you
may need to edit.

### systemd

The Deadeye containers are run using systemd instead of normal container restart
policies to work around Docker issues with camera device names.

Edit and install the `deadeye.service` systemd service definition as appropriate
for your system, for example:

```
Environment="DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE=/home/orangepi/deadeye/docker-compose.yml"
Environment="CAMERA_PATH=/dev/v4l/by-id/usb-Microsoft_MicrosoftÂ®_LifeCam_HD-3000-video-index0"
```

Install in `/etc/systemd/system/deadeye.service` and reload systemd services:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Operation

Start the Deadeye containers with:

```sh
sudo systemctl start deadeye
```

Stop the Deadeye containers with:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop deadeye
```

View container logs:

```sh
# in directory containing docker-compose.yaml
docker compose logs -f

# or alternatively, where SERVICE is one of: admin, daemon, web
docker compose logs $SERVICE
```

Updating the containers to a new version:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop deadeye

# in directory containing docker-compose.yaml
# edit the docker image tag(s) in docker-compose.yaml
docker compose pull

# it's a good idea to recreate the docker network
docker compose down

sudo systemctl start deadeye
```

Clean up old docker images and containers.

```sh
docker system prune
```
