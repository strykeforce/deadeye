# Deadeye

**Deadeye** is a vision system for FIRST<sup>Â®</sup> Robotics Competition
robots designed to be run on a vision coprocessor, such as a Linux single-board
computer. It has been actively used with the [Jetson Nano Developer Kit][jndk]
and [Orange Pi 5 Plus][orangepi]. It consists of several parts:

[orangepi]: http://www.orangepi.org/index.html

- Vision Daemon - C++ vision capture and processing pipeline.
- Client Library - Java library for use with FRC robots and other clients
- Admin Web UI - React web interface to manage Deadeye vision system.
- Admin Server and Tools - Python web service to connect admin web UI to vision
  daemon backend.
- Deployment Tools - Ansible playbooks for provisioning and deploying the
  system to vision coprocessors. **This method of deployment is deprecated in favor of using Docker (see below).**
