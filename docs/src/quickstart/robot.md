# Create Robot Project

Deadeye provides a Java client library ([javadocs](/javadoc/)) that can be
used in FRC robot programs to control and receive data from a Deadeye vision
co-processor. In this example, we'll use this library to connect to the Deadeye
pipeline we just configured and print out data about the sample image\'s
target.

## Create Project

We'll assume you are using [VS Code with the WPILib extension][vscode].

[vscode]: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/

See the WPILib VS Code instructions for [creating a robot
program][create-robot] and use the following settings for the **New Project
Creator**:

## Add Deadeye Library

For FRC robot projects, the Java client library is provided via a vendordeps
file:

> Download from: <http://maven.strykeforce.org/deadeye.json>

To install, use _VS Code âž” Install new libraries (online)_ and provide the
`deadeye.json` URL above.

Alternatively, you can install manually to your project vendordeps directory or
run the following Gradle task in your project directory to download and install
the Deadeye vendor dependency file:

```console
$ ./gradlew vendordep --url=http://maven.strykeforce.org/deadeye.json
```

## Robot Example

We can now program our robot to access the Deadeye vision pipeline we just
configured above. Since the example above is a `UprightRectPipeline` for
Deadeye camera `F0` (seen at top of admin dashboard page), we'll use this
information when programming our robot below.

### Deadeye Camera Class

The recommended way to use the Deadeye client library is to create a class that
represents each Deadeye camera, `DeadeyeF0` in our case.

Pipelines are designed to be used with their corresponding `TargetData` type,
so our `deadeye::UprightRectPipeline` uses a `UprightRectTargetData`:

Create `src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/DeadeyeF0.java` (replace `F0` with
the camera you are actually using):

```java
public class DeadeyeF0 implements TargetDataListener<UprightRectTargetData> {

  private final Deadeye<UprightRectTargetData> deadeye;

  public DeadeyeF0() {                                                // (1)
    deadeye = new Deadeye<>("F0", UprightRectTargetData.class);
    deadeye.setTargetDataListener(this);
  }

  public DeadeyeF0(NetworkTableInstance nti) {                        // (2)
    deadeye = new Deadeye<>("F0", UprightRectTargetData.class, nti);
    deadeye.setTargetDataListener(this);
  }

  public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) {                           // (3)
      deadeye.setEnabled(enabled);
  }

  @Override                                                           // (4)
  public void onTargetData(UprightRectTargetData data) {
      Point center = data.center;
      System.out.printf("x=%d, y=%d %n", center.x, center.y);
  }
}
```

**(1)** Create a new `Deadeye` object instance that will expect
`UprightRectTargetData` from camera `F0` and that uses the default
`NetworkTablesInstance`. Register this object as the designated
`TargetDataListener` for camera `F0`.

**(2)** Alternate constructor you may use if you are not using the default
`NetworkTablesInstance`. Normally this is _only_ needed when you are using a
Deadeye or robot simulator and you are using a separate stand-alone
`NetworkTablesInstance` for Deadeye. This [repo] contains an example of how to
use.

[repo]: https://github.com/strykeforce/olympics/tree/main/vision

**(3)** Enabled or disable camera `F0` pipeline. When enabled, the camera
lights will turn on and the pipeline will send target data.

**(4)** Implements `TargetDataListener.onTargetData()` and is called for every
camera frame processed through `F0` pipeline. This example implementation
extracts the target center point and prints it.

### Robot Class

Normally you would integrate the camera `DeadeyeF0` class above into a robot
`Subsystem` and activate from a `Command` but we\'ll keep it simple for the
purposes of this example.

Make the following additions to the standard `Robot` class in
`src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java`.

Initialize our robot's `DeadeyeF0` object in the `robotInit()` method.

```java
private DeadeyeF0 deadeyeF0;

@Override
public void robotInit() {
  // ...
  deadeyeF0 = new DeadeyeF0();
}
```

Enable camera `F0` when enabling the robot in tele-operation mode.

```java
@Override
public void teleopInit() {
  // ...
  deadeyeF0.setEnabled(true);
}
```

And disable the camera when disabling the robot.

```java
@Override
public void disabledInit() {
  deadeyeF0.setEnabled(false);
}
```

### Deploy and Run

If your pipeline is tuned as above you should see target data for the
sample image large target in the **robot log** when you enable the
robot:

    x=212, y=91
    x=212, y=91
